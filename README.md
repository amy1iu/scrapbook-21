summer startup work

Scrapbook is a new social media that combines aspects of Snapchat, Instagram, and Tiktok to create an interactive and personal experience. Users are presented with daily prompts on their home page that can be swiped left and right: right opens the camera for you to take a photo or video that matches up to the prompt you've swiped open, and left opens up the collection of media matching the prompt that all of your friends have uploaded to the app. Scrapbook saves the photos and videos that you take, captioned with the prompt that you responded to, and creates a scrapbook! of all your media. It's a proactive social media and easily scalable to include other features, such as group scrapbooks or user-sourced prompts.
